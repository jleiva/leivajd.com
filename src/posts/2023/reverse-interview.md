Reverse interview, _entrevistar al entrevistador_, y ver si ellos son un fit para uno. Un par de buenos recursos, y mis preguntas favoritas:

- What has been a challenge for this job in the past?
- Why are you looking to fill this role
- What is the most important impact I can make in the 90 days
- What are major trends affecting the company in the next year or two
- What makes someone successful is there something I should do to be successful from day one?
- What have you learned or how have you changed since working here?
- What problem could I tackle for you quickly in this job?
- Based on the interview, what feedback do you have for me?
- What’s the employee turnover?
- What's the on-call plan/schedule?
- What does the onboarding look like?
- How do you test code?
- How do you integrate and deploy changes? Is it CI/CD?
- How quickly can you setup a new local test environment for the product?
- What happens when the team misses a release target?
- How’s the engineering culture?
- What’s the current tech stack?
- Where is the engineering team located? It is fully remote?
- How big is the team?
- Do you have any concerns about my experience or skill set?
- When was the last time you took time off? Whats the expectation when youre on vacations? expected that employees be checking emails, slack messages, etc. when OOO.
