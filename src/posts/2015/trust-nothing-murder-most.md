Mike Monteiro, sobre defender ideas solo por que sí

> To design is to solve problems. To be a designer is to be driven by the need to find something that needs solving (of which there is never a shortage), and to do the work of coming up with the right solution. Knowing if it is the right solution means replacing what wasn’t working with your proposed solution and waiting to see if the situation improves.
