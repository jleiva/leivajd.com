> As a general rule, itâ€™s always worth asking if you can accomplish something with a less powerful technology:

> - Instead of using JavaScript to do animation, see if you can do it in CSS instead.
> - Instead of using JavaScript to do simple client-side form validation, try to use HTML input types and attributes like `required`.
> - Instead of using ARIA to give a certain role value to a `div` or `span`, try to use a more suitable HTML element instead.
