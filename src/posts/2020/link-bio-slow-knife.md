El "link in bio" de Instagram no solo es molesto, tambi&eacute;n es una manera de mantenernos, a nosotros los usuarios, encerrados dentro de la plataforma.

[Anil Dash](https://anildash.com/2019/12/10/link-in-bio-is-how-they-tried-to-kill-the-web/):

> But killing off links is a strategy. It may be presented as a cost-saving measure, or as a way of reducing the sharing of untrusted links. But it is a strategy, designed to keep people from the open web, the place where they can control how, and whether, someone makes money off of an audience. The web is where we can make sites that don’t abuse data in the ways that Facebook properties do.
