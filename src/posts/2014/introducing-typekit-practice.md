Tim Brown, Typekit:

> Fonts are great, but using them well can be hard. Volumes have been written about typography, yet every good designer will say there are no rules; there is no magic formula for success. Typography simply takes practice. Typography is a practice.

> So today, weâ€™re launching a new website: [Typekit Practice](http://practice.typekit.com/), a place where novices and experts alike can hone their typographic skills. We hope it will help students learn, help teachers teach, and help professionals stay sharp.
