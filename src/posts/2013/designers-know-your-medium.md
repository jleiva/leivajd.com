Scott Kellum lo deja muy claro, si sos diseñador web, [tenés que conocer tu medio](http://scottkellum.com/2013/08/13/designers-know-your-medium.html).

> Code is the language of the medium and without knowing it you are going to end up frustrated and unable to communicate clearly with your team. Learn code and you will be able to execute better ideas faster.
